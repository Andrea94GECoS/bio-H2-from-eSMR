In the Results folder the files are divided by location. 
There are 4 Excel files at each location, with hourly energy balances of inflexible and flexible case systems, and with short- and long-term renewable and battery cost.
In each Excel file there are several subfolders, each with results for a renewable energy share (up to RENS=100%), and is possible to find hourly energy balances for the system (e.g., Electricity from PV, wind, state of charge of gaseous and battery storages, chemical island load), as well as tables that integrate the results on an annual basis. 
The last subfolder of the Excel files summarizes the annual results for the different RENS.

In the Results folder are also the results for large-scale plant results with RENS =95%, for short- and long-term scenario.

The Excel file "BGSY_paper.xlsm" contains the results (on an annual basis) of all scenarios analyzed in the paper, and there are comparisons between systems.
